This DJ Soundboard was a fun project that allowed me to use a majority of my integrated circuits knowledge to produce a fully functional
DJ Soundboard. The DJ Soundboard works by pressing one of four buttons and producing layers of sound that can be placed ontop of each
other to produce musical tracks.<br>
